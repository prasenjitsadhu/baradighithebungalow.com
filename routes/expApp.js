    content: "<p>Where are you? Of the many wonders of fusions of nature's virgin innites and man's enveloping creations,I am proudly one of them. I reside 45 kilometres away from the enchantingly small railway station at New Jalpaiguri, the garden mingles into the surrounding landscape in the rich green of the unending tea gardens that border National Highway - 31. Nestled in the many riverbanks of the region, I boast a sprawling 507 hectares of tea plantations.</p> <h5>GORUMARA NATIONAL PARK</h5> <p>The Gorumara National Park has fifty recorded species of mammals, 194 species of bird, 22 species of reptiles, 7 species of turtles, 27 species of fish, and other macro and micro fauna. The Park is rich in large herbivores including Indian rhinoceros, gaur, Asian elephant, sloth bear, chiral, and sambhar deer. Tigers are occasionally spotted here. It also has numerous small carnivores including various civets, mongoose and small cats.</p> <p>Birds at the Gorumara National Park include submontane forest birds like the scarletminivet, sunbird, Asian paradise flycatchers, spangled drongo, and Indian hornbill.The Park is also home to a large number of snakes, venomous and non-venomous, including the Indian python, one of the largest snakes in the world, and the king cobra — the world’s largest venomous snake.</p> <h5>CHAPRAMARI WILDLIFE SANCTUARY</h5> <p> The Chapramari Wildlife Sanctuary has a total coverage of 960 hectares of forest. A large variety of flora and fauna are found here. Chapramari is known for its elephant population. Gaurs are not uncommon in the region. Rhinoceros, deer, boars, and leopards are also found here. However, Royal Bengal Tigers are not found here. The place is popular with bird watchers, with parakeets, kingfishers, and green pigeons found in abundance. </p> <h5>JALDAPARA NATIONAL PARK</h5> <p> Established in 1941, the Jaldapara National Park is situated at the foothills of the Eastern Himalayas in Alipurduar District of North Bengal and on the banks of the Torsa River. The nearby Chilapata Forest is an elephant corridor between Jaldapara and Buxa Tiger Reserve. The forest is mainly savannah covered with tall elephant grasses. The main attraction of the Park is the Indian one-horned rhinoceros. The Park holds the largest rhino population in India after Kaziranga National Park in Assam. Other animals in the Park include Indian leopard, Indian elephants, sambhar deer, barking deer, spotted deer, hog deer, wild boars, and gaur. </p> <p> Jaldapara is a paradise for bird watchers. It is one of the very few places in India where the Bengal florican is sighted. The other birds to be found here are the crested eagle, Pallas’s fish eagle, shikra, Finn’s weaver, Jungle fowl, peafowl (peacock),panridge, lesser-pied hornbill. Pythons, monitor lizards, kralts, cobras, geckos, and about eight species of fresh water turtles can also be seen in abundance here. </p> <h5>BUXA RESERVE AND FORT</h5> <p> The fort is located at an altitude of 867 meters(2.844 feet) in the Buxa Tiger Reserve, Alipurduar district.It is located 30 kilometers from Alipurduar, the nearest town. The Bhutan King used the fort to protect the portion of famous SilkRoute connecting Tibet with India, via Bhutan. </p> <p> The Buxa Reserve ranges in altitude from 200 feet in the Gangetic Plains to 5,740 feet bordering the Himalayas in the north. At least 284 bird species inhabit the reserve. Mammals include Asian elephant, gaur, Sambar deer, clouded leopard, Indian leopard, and Bengal tiger. There are a number of trekking routes through the jungle. There is a 4 km further trek to Rovers’ Point or Romney Dara (the land of beautiful birds at 4,500 feet.</p> <h5>MURTI RIVER </h5> <p> The Murti River originates high in the mountains of the Neora Valley National Park. Starting its journey from near the Bengal – Sikkim – Bhutan border, the river runs downs the hills to enter into the Dooars region. For much of its route, the Chapramari Wildlife Sanctuary falls to the eastern side of the river and the western side sees some of the best and most picturesque tea gardens of Dooars. After crossing Dhupjora, the Murti River flows through both the Chapramari Wildlife Sanctuary and the Gorumara National Park. The riverside is one of the most picturesque and serene sights in the Dooars Valley. The river is fed by monsoons, and during the dry months, it can be easily crossed by foot.Many of the watchtowers of Gorumara and Chapramari forests are built on the banks of the MurtiRiver. </p>"

    content: "<p>Baradighi is home to a fascinatingly diverse array of people. Differing in their origins, cultures, work and lifestyles, these people unite and live in harmony under the banner of the Baradighi Tea Estate. Life at Baradighi is driven by deep-rooted religious, cultural, practical and community customs, and by the demands of the climate and status. But the overarching umbrella of purpose and unending work at the estates, and the many cultures on it, blend in the wok that Baradighi is, in its timelessness, and its youthfully energetic daily routines.</p> <p>The nearest post office to us is Matelli. The heritage tea house is sandwiched between three villages, the nearest village, the Baradighi village, right across the river, and Disco Bazaar village. The first British settlers at the estate brought in workers from the neighbouring villages in the old Unified Greater Bengal, and now Jharkhand. The cheapest labour was found amongst the adivasi, or tribal clans, of southern Jharkhand, and that’s how the estate got its first guests, in the 1890s.</p> <p>Years since, the descendants of the original workers have maintained their ancestral love for the land, and 90% of the few thousands of workers on estate are Adivasis, or tribals.</p> <h5>Lifestyle</h5> <p>The original Adivasis were (and those in Jharkhand remain) hunter-gatherers. Over the years, as hunting became illegal, they switched to sustaining on poultry and farm meat, and a healthy crop of farm animals sustain the current families. They are particularly distinct in their diet of wild roots and plants, their main food. From the estate and surrounding forest areas, they gather leafy vegetables including both those known to urban dwellers, and some unknown ones. Locally known as <em>jungle saag</em>, or wild vegetable, plants like <em>kulekhaada </em>are commonly found, and children right from the ages of 9 or 10 are trained in the art of collecting their food from the natural neighbourhood.</p> <p><em>Ningro,</em> another plant indigenous to the area, is found in increasing numbers as one drives up the slopes to the hill station at Darjeeling, and the elevation of a tea estate determines the amount of Ningro representation in the natives’ diets.</p> <p>The Baradighi natives drink a heady and strong form of liquor, closest in composition to rice beer. It is made locally and stored in <em>dekchis</em>, or boxes and is known for its quick fermentation and mass distribution. Drinking as merriment, custom and on holidays is an indispensable part of the social life.</p> <p>Particularly skilled in the art of collecting wild mushrooms, a major part of their dinner plates are mushroom dishes. A keen eye and years of conditioned observation lets the Baradighi native differentiate edible mushrooms from non-edible or poisonous ones. They also consume some mildly or semi-poisonous mushrooms, which their years of conditioning to consume it makes them partly immune to. Perhaps harmful to visitors, to natives, it results in non-fatal and at times deliberate intoxication.</p> <p>Adivasis are nature-worshippers, and believe in animal sacrifice. Like all faith, their customs relate to the nuances of their immediate environment, and the prayers for rain, crop, safety and prosperity, along with popular state-wide festival celebrations, dot the calendar. In what is perhaps their most important time of the year, every monsoon-end, they pray to the karam tree.</p> <h5>The Karam puja (worship)</h5> <p>Origins of this legend remain unclear. While some claim it began while the current dwellers’ ancestors were escaping their British tormentors, landlords or slave-masters in recent centuries, others claim it dates back to the time tribals were driven out of their forest dwellings to be labourers for the Mughal Empire. But they agree on the significance of the prayers. In times when they had to escape enemies, the tribals hid, en masse, in the hollow barks of the massive karam trees, found in large numbers in the nearby forests. Once safe, they would celebrate their escape and developed reverence for the tree. It resulted in periodic prayers to the tree by the refuge-seekers. They would pass down this tradition to their descendants, and up to this day, the dwellers celebrate the tree’s presence pompously, with the tree being decorated like an idol, people dressed in finery, elaborate religious ceremonies, offerings and general merriment.</p> <p>The tree is still regarded as a metaphorical protector of the natives, and is prayed to in times of crisis and as a problem-solver. The natives are majorly Christian, but mix such popular beliefs with organized religion to lend it an ingenuity of their own.</p> <h5>Sub-divisions</h5> <p>Based on their language evolution, the Adivasis are divided into two segments- the Mundas and Oraons.</p> <p>Generally, the local populace speaks Sadhri, a slightly difficult tongue for even Indian guests to the estate. Further complexities to the basic language appear due to dialectic divisions. The Mundas, living right behind the heritage tea Bungalow, speak Minder, an older tongue, while the Oraons speak a more recent tongue called Inderminder.</p> <h5>Utilities</h5> <p>They provide for themselves with locally found equipment, or clever craftsmanship of local resources. They live in temporary or permanent single storey structures, with clusters, called ‘lines’, that were 100-year old demarcations based on the area of the estate the people from a particular family originally worked in. Housing was provided such that it had high proximity to the part of Baradighi that a family worked in. Social relations remain community-oriented, based on their ‘lines’, but inter-line cultural practices, events and schooling and welfare systems thrive. Clubs, places of worship and a common hospital make lifestyle common, and socially active.</p> <h5>Haat</h5> <p>The quintessential Indian roadside market, with its antiquity, has stayed on at Baradighi.</p> <p>In recent years, the haat, or local market, has seen much traction, and sellers come from afar. Baradighi is home to 3 haats or markets, where utensils, household equipment, school utilities, work utilities and individual-need products abound. The nearest village, Disco Bazaar, hosts a market every day in its ready-made stone marketplace structures and is a buzz with activity on Sundays with the sellers displaying their wares on the pavements, and buyers coming in droves….negotiating, checking quality and buying in bulk. The Sunday market is a popular draw in the area.</p> <p>The Mangalbari haat is open on Thursdays, while Baradighi’s own haat is organized on the day of wage disbursement. Savings form a small part of the planning considerations, and sellers sync calendars to ensure their presence in the area at the time of wage disbursement at the estate. All commodities are sold by weight, including utensils&#8211; where the individual units do not carry any value in the shops.</p> <h5>Other Clans</h5> <p>Another clan existing on the heritage tea house estate is the Gorkhas, the natives of hill states and of Nepal, famed as both warriors and agriculturists. While they have world-renowned, deeply researched and elaborate cultures of their own, they form a small part of the population on estate. They are both Hindus and Buddhists, but prefer a loud form of worship including chants and elaborate ceremonies. Their diet of meat and vegetables, and comparatively more financially planned lifestyle, well-made and well-purchased home equipment and ability to blend in have made them an important part of the village here.</p> <p>Baradighi hosts a significant population of the Kumhars and Majhis, residents of Bihar mainland and brought here for work as assistants in plumbing, cleaning and civilian jobs in first decade of the 1900s. Small populations of Mohammedans, and a single, warm, Chinese family, known and loved for the diverse practices they bring to the culture of the estate, form the remnant of the family here.</p> <p>Like with our Chinese residents, now in their second generation in Baradighi, our natives are descendants of workers brought to work here by past managers on estate, and having loved the hospitality, opportunity, or both, of Baradighi and its people, have chosen to stay here for generations, having gradually become part of the family. Baradighi is a wok of these diverse cultures.</p> <p>That aptly represents the warmth of Baradighi. Every visit is the beginning to a story. Those who come knocking are quick to call it home and add their own flavour to it.</p> <h5>The Curious Fishermen</h5> <p>The residents of the 120-years old Rungamattee line in Baradighi have developed a curious method of fishing. The line has been close to the river, and has thus depended on it as a primary source of food. But poverty has prevented them from using elaborate techniques or equipment to capture their fish.</p> <p>Starting from the banks of the river, 10-15 men move in a line, each with his shoulders on the others’ arms, and feet tightly together, wading through the river very slowly. The aim is to catch bottom dweller fishes that rest close to the sediment beds on the shallow banks. Catfish and Loches are common prey. As the men move ahead slowly, these fishes, obstructed or hit by the feet of one person, try escaping by swimming to either side, but are still met with human feet, for a long distance. Those who feel the fish under their feet tell their neighbours, and try and keep it locked there, while those to the left or right bend down, capture the fish with bare hands, and throw it into the large common net the group carries with it, before moving back in place so the group can resume its travel.</p> <p>This economical and effective method has sustained the innovative people of the Rungamattee labourer lines for decades, and they learn it early on, with even the children playing their part in carrying nets or forming their own amateur fishermen lines.</p>"

    content: "<p>When the British landed on India’s shores, they knew little of the vast expanse of land they would soon claim and use to produce the Chinese drink they would soon swear by. As it were, the-soon-to-be fantastic discovery of tea would give work to generations, change the landscape of forests in areas like North Bengal forever, and create a titanic industry, and give birth to heritage tea bungalows… All while leaving behind the scenic tea gardens – abodes for seekers of tranquil, and saviours from the hustle of the future metropolis.</p> <p>That’s perhaps why they never chronicled the founding of the majestic tea estates.</p> <p>One such non-chronicled discovery was of Baradighi Tea Estate. Little is known of the first days of this heritage tea house, but collections of recollections from old-timers and archives leave a teasingly incomplete story of the birth of the majestic 600 acres of pastoral and production-induced pompousness.</p> <p>The name itself would be a misnomer. The Baradighi village is actually not on the tea estate. It is across the Neora River, and owes its name to the estate.</p> <p>In 1880, the first British businessmen and landowners arrived in Jalpaiguri, a land already known for its historyof being blessed by the Buddha when he travelled through it. Having discovered tea in Darjeeling, they were experimenting to see how far below the slopes of the hill town they could plant tea upto. The Baradighi estate, set on the banks of the Neora <em>nadi</em>, was unique to Bengal. The land had no label, and locals found it difficult to address it and inform people of where the masters had called them to work. And they invented a name that stuck.</p> <p>The Bengali word <em>dighi</em>, Bengali word for ‘the riverside mound’, would be used to denote the geographical location for workers to report to. As the land expanded, they began to refer to the 12 noticeable mounds individually to demarcate spots.</p> <p>Soon, local parlance normalized the usage of <em>Bara</em>, or 12, and <em>dighi</em>, to refer to the British tea growing land of Baradighi, sprawled across roughly twelve such riverside mounds.</p> <p>But it was decades away from being the estate it is.</p> <p>Baradighi (or ‘that place with 12 hills’) was a quick favourite. Its factory, established in 1893, produced some of the finest teas, due to its handy labour. The estate itself, rich in soil since it was on a river bank, would produce the most serene sights, and the best tea leaf.</p> <p>In the many years that followed, growers in the Baradighi region merged to form a single large territory, gradually increasing in size what the locals called Baradighi. But it was in 1890 that Baradighi Tea Estate would be formed, registered locally. The village housing workers on the estate acquired the same appellation and was called Baradighi village. That same year, the Baradighi Company was formed, with British masters.</p> <p>This heritage tea house and estate owes its fine qualities to the wisdom of many managers. The fourth British manager, Sir W.L. Travers, headed the estate for 26 years, and added fine aspects to the work culture, including the gong signalling work times, the initial Estate Manager’s bungalow and the division of labour residences, creating, unknowingly, a community demarcation that would last across cultures and beyond the century.</p> <p>Much of the tale of Baradighi in British India is lost. In 1935, the firm came under Jardine Henderson, a Calcutta company, and in 1950, when its British masters left India, having handed over to new Indian owners, they would burn every last piece of paper, leaving no trace of their exploits, and with no faces to the names of the Englishmen who made the estate.</p> <p>Now in Indian hands, the firm was merged with other tea estates in 1960’s, to form Rydak Syndicate Limited, which runs the estate to this day. Little has changed on ground since. The workers are natives, living in temporary shelters, and remain emotionally attached to the land. The British gong that would ring through 100s of acres to signal mealtimes gave way to a siren. Tea making shifted from the orthodox hand-picking of fine teas, rolled leaves and longer, manual make to the modern cut-tear-curl method.</p> <p>The train station at Baradighi was built in the 1960s. That significantly changed communities’ social living. Schools had always been in existence. Now they were formalized and government-run. Workers’ clubs, temples, churches, mosques and markets made it a town of its own. In 2011’s census, some 6000 people work at Baradighi.</p> <p>An Englishman’s bungalow is his castle. India’s numerous tea estates had some lavish heritage tea bungalows. Baradighi boasted of housing lawns, 40 servants, clubs, and unending bakery items, Indian delicacies, guests, wine and hunting prey and gear- so residents never missed the English countryside or culture.</p> <p>But when the Baradighi Tea Company grew in 1930’s, the firm built its owners and guests a bungalow like no other. Built over two years in the decade of the 30’s, a red-bricked two-storey and 4-bedroom structure with lawns and fountains comprised the original form. Today, that part comprises just the left flank.</p> <p>Built in traditional European style, the bungalow was envisaged by the architects to expect additions to the build, and they left the staircase on the edge, with an infinite view of the horizon from its running balcony, and a view of the Kanchenjunga peak from the main bedroom’s rear window.</p> <p>As if on cue, in the 1950s, with a mix of Gothic and Early Renaissance architecture, the Indians had a right flank built, adding a drawing room and dining hall. At the far end, one room acted as the office of the owner. The heritage tea househas novel architecture, with wooden walls, chimney manholes and large, palatial rooms inspired by the royal housing of the Europeans.</p> <p>The Bungalow has hosted its best. Legend has it that the Viceroy of India was resident there in 1945. He was on his way to Darjeeling when the servants in his entourage heard of the beauty of the tea estates in Dooars. Word was sent out that the Viceroy wished to stay in one of the estates to experience the Dooars first-hand. After much search, his Indian assistants chose Baradighi’s fine bungalow for his stay. Since his stay, the estate had the permission to fly the Union Jack on its rooftop. It was lowered only when Indians took over in 1959.</p> <p>Rydak had superintendents and officers overseeing more than two estates. The superintendent was an important man, and the only planter superior to the loyal, monarch-like managers. Naturally, they became post-Independence royalty in India’s heritage tea bungalows, and lived in style. The superintendent of the company’s tea estates was given permanent residence at Baradighi. The palatial Viceroy Bungalow was the residence of the Superintendent. This is how it attained its latest form.</p> <p>Many tales of the last decades of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, written or experienced by planters, their children or their spouses are set in the Baradighi superintendent’s bungalow. As per many accounts, there was an airstrip behind the bungalow, where the officers from Calcutta would land, and reference is made to an old Ciena plane used by the firm. But it serves as legend alone, believable only by the looks of other evidence of past luxury on the estate.</p> <p>Over years, the <em>memsahib</em>, wives of the superintendents, added much to the bungalow, in the process creating a sight the modern luxury-seeker, or nature-lover, would relish. Flower beds, gardens, décor, walls, furniture, tennis courts, garden sheds, tree houses, a broadened view of the estate from the grand running balcony, castle-like dressing rooms and intricately designed gateways all made a package that are now untraceably part of the bungalow, and to the 21<sup>st</sup> century eye appear part of the original structure.</p> <p>At the peak of its grandeur, this house featured in Inside Outside, a lifestyle magazine. It remains one of Asia’s oldest, sturdiest and most opulent heritage tea bungalows.</p> <p>It fell into disrepair in the late 1990s, when technology drove the Bungalow into obsolescence by reducing the need for superintendents to be resident for long periods. In the mid-2000s, a proposal was moved to convert the premises to a hotel exhibiting the Bungalow’s past pomp and grandeur, and the legacy of North Bengal’s plantation culture. With government approval and the addition of modern facilities in 2019, the Bungalow was made liveable again.</p> <p>There are still antique documents, artefacts, books and selected works or remnants of old newspapers to be found every now and then on the vast premises. Much of the Bungalow’s history remains subject to imagination.</p> <p>The Baradighi natives, fireplace, stones, bush, architecture and fauna bear the pride and veneer of erudite lifestyle that was once frequent there. <em>And in the lap of the Bungalow at Baradighi, it is your turn to tread down history’s lanes, and feel like its pampered residents and guests once did.</em></p>"
